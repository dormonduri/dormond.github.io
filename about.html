        <p1> Hello!  This is my About Me page on my Programming Portfolio website. <br>
            I am a current sophomore at URI.  I transferred here this fall from <a href="https://springfieldcollegepride.com/sports/fball/index"> Springfield College</a>, where I played football. <br>
          I am from Cranston, RI and I am currently communting to the Kingston Campus full-time. <br>
            I am currently an undecided major looking heavily at the Computer Science pathway. <br>
            This is my first programming class, other than very basic coding my Freshman year of high school. <br>
            I look forward to improving my skills and seeing the progress I have made throughout the semester.

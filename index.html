       <h1 style="text-align:center;">Welcome to Daniel's Programming Portfolio</h1>
        <p1 style="text-align:center;"> Hello! My name is Daniel Ormond.  I am a transfer sophomore at URI.  This will be my programming home page for The Joy of Programming class at the university.  I have written this website using basic code and will work on expanding this website throughout the semester.  I have added Javascript and About Me pages that will be added to as the semester continues.</p1>

        <p1 style="text-align:center"> Hello! My name is Daniel Ormond.  I am a transfer sophomore at URI.  This will be my programming portfolio Home Page for The Joy of Programming at the university.  I have written this website using basic HTML code and will work on expanding this website throughout the semester.  I have added Javascript and About Me pages that will be added to as the semester continues.  I look forward to looking back at this Home Page at the end of the semester and see how much I've grown in the coding world!</p1>

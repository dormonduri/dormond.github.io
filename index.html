        <p1> Hello! My name is Daniel Ormond.  I am a transfer sophomore at <a href="http://www.uri.edu"> University of Rhode Island.</a>  This will be my programming portfolio Home Page for The Joy of Programming at the university.<br>
           I have written this website using basic HTML code and will work on expanding this website throughout the semester.  <br>
            I have added Javascript and About Me pages that will be added to as the semester continues.  <br>
            The Javascript page is where I will be adding future codes and the About Me page will be filled with facts about me, my major, and my journey into Computer Science!<br>
            I look forward to looking back at this Home Page at the end of the semester and see how much I've grown in the coding world!</p1>

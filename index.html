        <p1> Hello! My name is Daniel Ormond.  I am a transfer sophomore at URI.  This will be my programming portfolio Home Page for The Joy of Programming at the university.<br>
           I have written this website using basic HTML code and will work on expanding this website throughout the semester.  <br>
            I have added Javascript and About Me pages that will be added to as the semester continues.  <br>
            I look forward to looking back at this Home Page at the end of the semester and see how much I've grown in the coding world!</p1>
